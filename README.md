# Remote TV Timer App

## Project Overview
The Remote TV Timer App is a Java-based application designed to control connected devices like Android TVs and PlayStation 4 consoles using timers. Users can set up a timer to remotely wake up or shut down their devices over the network. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built using Swing and leverages Wake-on-LAN functionality to operate the devices.

## Installation
To run the Remote TV Timer App, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 8 or higher.
2. **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** - This should be installed and added to your system's PATH to enable communication with Android devices.

You can clone the repository and compile it using the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd RemoteTVTimerApp
javac RemoteTVTimerApp.java MainApp.java
java MainApp
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the repository where the code is hosted.

## Usage
1. Start the application. This will open the Remote TV Timer graphical interface.
2. Enter the IP addresses of the Android TV and the PlayStation 4.
3. Set the start and shutdown timers in seconds.
4. Click on "Start Timers" to initiate the wake-up and shutdown processes according to the defined timers.
5. Use "Stop Timers" to cancel any active timers.

## Features
- Input fields for entering the IP addresses of devices.
- Timer settings for both starting and shutting down devices.
- Real-time status updates displayed in a status area.
- Wake-on-LAN capability for starting devices.
- Capability to send shutdown commands to Android TV using ADB.

## Dependencies
If your project uses additional libraries, you can add them in a `package.json` file for tracking. However, based on the provided files, no specific dependencies were found in `package.json` or reference to external libraries; everything is handled via the Java Standard Library and ADB commands.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following primary files:

- **RemoteTVTimerApp.java**: The main GUI application logic that handles the timers and communicates with the devices.
- **MainApp.java**: The entry point to the application, initializing the model, view, and controller.
- **Model**: Handles data related to the devices (e.g., IP addresses, timers).
- **View**: Presents the interface to the user.
- **Controller**: Implements the functionality that bridges the model and view, though details of this are simplified in the provided code snippets.
